===============================REACT==============================
it a library
it is scombination of html+js => jsx
tailwind is a type of css
developed by meta 2013
reacts work on SPA(single page application)
react makes a single page application
react is fast
it is a single page application
it is component based
it get the code easier 
and less line of codes
react uses render nad reload
react uses virtual dom in place of DOM
it uses virtual dom which may cause fast response in any page
react has not one virtual dom it has two (old,new)  (when it compares new virtual dom into old virtual dom)=> this process is said to be named **Diffing**  **
it has extension like:- .jsx
json is a dummy database which is in a format of array of object.
CRA old bundler
VITE latest bundler which is superfast:


to install this open terminal:-   npm(node package manager) is is fasther 15x faster than CRA 


syntax to download:- npm create vite@latest _appname_    for e.g -- npm create vite@latest App

     -- it is ES bulit
ES build converts jsx into javascript code .(earlier babel is used: but is slower)
browser only understands html css and js code thats why we use ES build which changes jsx file into javascript code.
framework vs libraries difference (HW)
npm stands for note package manager
when we installed packages and run the code :-

public folder- videos photos can be stored.
src folder-:
assets- photos/videos,-:
app.css-: it applies the css in a particular component
================main.jsx is a main file=====================
strict mode is used to run the code twice.. (we can remove strict code

it converts the js code into html code 
export are of 2 types-:
name export
default export
to run again past one code-:
**npm run dev**

**ES build converts js codde into html code 
pakage json used to verify he file is installed or not**
components always converts the code it is said to be function

syntax-:
import React from "react"
jsx rule-:
1. it must be start with capital letters function or component should be written as first letter capital {e.g - App}
2. the code must be written in curly brases{}
3. return = > it returns only the single element
4. it must be exported
syntax:- export default app  (default export)
syntax:- name export - : {footer1,footer2}  (in curly brases)    as :- import {footer1,footer2}   export as:- export {dooter1,footer2}


return(
<h1>hello cybrom</h1>

=========================================20/11/25========================================
entry point =>main.jsx
                  |
                  |
               app.jsx      ('import' of navbar.jsx)
                  |
                  |
              navbar.jsx    ('export' to app.jsx)
after export we have to import in app.jsx
              
in vs code component should be visible in green color





rule:-
if we have to wite javascript we have to write in curly brases{}



==========================================21-11-2025============================================


inline css always use to write in object format {}
so we will write two {{}} one for js one for object

to add image we use two way
if image is inside public then directly write in image address
if image is inside src assest folder then firstly import any name of image from "./assest/"image name"" then using img tag and inside src write with {}


Propse(properties)- use to pass data from one component to another 
the main problem inn propse is data pass in parent-->child
if its not the child then data won't get pass


=========================================22-11-2025========================================
                                     
                                       
react fragment:- <> </> its an empty tag used as a replacement for div

rafce +enter will create a complet component its like doctage in html that gives full 

es7+react extension download

we can write propse or any name on child.jsx using {} we pass data in form of key value

advantage of parse is we don't have to create multiple cart or anything again and again so by propse we simply change name and info and rest is same useful for 
big site like flipkart,amazon


=======================================24-11-2025===========================================

h.w make a cart of 3 required fields of name,image,email


=======================================26-11-2025===========================================

by default react always create site for phone 
0-640-default
640-768=> sm: (small device)
768-1024=> md: (medium device)
1024+ => lg:  (large device)  

here order will matter so we will apply in starting like initially for less than 640px we hidden display then sm:block 
means one by onr and on md-flex

now to apply icon we use react icon site then scroll down and run dirst command to install then seaarch for whatever 
icon we want then copy the first command paste on above and then use the tag and write it on wherever we want

component always return jsx

======================================27/11/2025===========================================

route have two attributes named path and element
path e.g:- '/' (default path)


====================================================================
whenever 'use' used it means it's HOOk 
hook is used input any function of react

'usestate'  == > state management 
whenever any state is to be changed in react we use 'usestate'   it Updates UI and re-render
react says if anything want to saw in react page we have to use 'usestate'



=================================/04/12/25=====================

Form Handling -- it has two -- 1.controlled   (React knows only )    2. uncontrolled

to stop refreshor any reload of page we have to use predefined method named preventDefault

================================05/12/2025=====================

in form validation the name,value and other... works in only 'attribute' it not work on funtions

===============================06/12/2025============================

//dr appointment website(react)

=================================8/12/25====================================

AOS library

=================================11/12/25================================

in json everything is stored in {} sytax and "" this internally


================================12/12/2025==============================

useeffects is a funtion which is automatically used while entering the page as default when we use [] as default 1 time ([] it is said to be dependency array)


npm i axios       in terminall for installing 

sync line by line is js 
async is cant wait
await is a funtion which waits 

in react .then and .catch

200 is for success
